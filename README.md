## HOW TO USE DEPLOYED INSTANCE

------

1. Access the API documentation page hosted at [https://revna-bio-coding-test-ussd-app.onrender.com/docs](https://revna-bio-coding-test-ussd-app.onrender.com/docs). This provides basic utilities for managing users.
2. Add a user with a functional phone number. 
3. Create an account at https://account.africastalking.com/ and access the sandbox app.
4. Using a shared service code, create a channel and set the callback URL to https://revna-bio-coding-test-ussd-app.onrender.com/ussd
5. Provide the phone number specified for the user on **Step 2** to the simulator. Make sure to use the phone number format accepted by the simulator for the user as well.

*NB: If you have issues setting up the Africa's Talking sandbox for testing, refer to their tutorial at [Documentation | Africa's Talking (africastalking.com)](https://developers.africastalking.com/tutorials/building-an-offline-account-management-application-using-ussd)*
